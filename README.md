# Message Log
While I already did an Azure based approach for this, the current project
is to make the message log work on a mini web server / NAS. Since those are
ridiculously powerful now anyway that won't be too much of an issue, but
well, rewrite.

## Infrastructure Requirements
Putting this on OpenMediaVault, so first of all I need to install Docker.
